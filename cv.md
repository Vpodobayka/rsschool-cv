#### About Me
I started learning HTML/CSS back in 2007. Then I began to explore Photoshop, Illustrator, Macromedia Flash, Premiere Pro, 3D Max, and FL Studio. In general, there was no time for hanging out behind garages since there were many fascinating programs to learn. During school, I attended the STEP Computer Academy, specializing in "Web Design," where I solidified some of my knowledge. Some time ago, I returned to HTML/CSS, but my heart leaned more towards studying the backend, particularly JavaScript. I am also interested in the field of Security, specifically PenTesting. Previously with frustration, but now with interest, I am learning more about Linux and some of its distributions, such as Kali. Virtual machines are also of interest to me.

In short, there are only 24 hours in a day, and the number of interests and the time to explore them is quite limited. As soon as I know that my skills are up to something more serious, for example, when I delve into React, I promise I will redo this CV. But for now, I need to finish with this writing... You understand, right? :)
